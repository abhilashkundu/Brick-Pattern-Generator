# Image Brick Pattern Generator

## Overview
The **Image Brick Pattern Generator** is a Unity-based application that divides an image texture into a grid of "bricks." Each brick displays a section of the original image, creating a visually appealing puzzle-like effect. This project is useful for games, UI elements, or artistic applications requiring dynamic image presentations.

## Features
- **Dynamic Brick Generation**: Automatically generates bricks based on specified row and column counts.
- **Custom Spacing**: Set spacing between bricks to customize the layout.
- **Accurate UV Mapping**: Ensures each brick displays the correct portion of the original image.
- **Prefab Management**: Use a prefab for bricks to allow easy customization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear error handling and informative debug messages.

## Technical Details

- **Game Engine**: Unity
- **UI Component**: Unity UI system (using `RawImage` for brick textures)
